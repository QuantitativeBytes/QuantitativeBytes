### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I firmly believe that no problem can be solved unless it can first be measured. I specialize in writing software to make quantitative measurements from multi-dimensional raw data, bringing new intelligence to clinical and research problem solving. I primarily code in Matlab, C++ and Python, using whichever tool is most appropriate to the problem at hand. Working at the boundary between data science and software engineering, I have extensive experience of all aspects of research software development, ranging from the design and implementation of fundamental image and signal processing algorithms, through user-interface design and implementation, to statistical analysis and reporting.

I am passionate believer in the value of sharing my enthusiasm for and knowledge of science and engineering to educate and inspire others. In my spare time I run the QuantitativeBytes YouTube channel for exactly this purpose, with a focus on scientific computing. I create educational content and tutorials on a variety of topics with an emphasis on practical implementation, focusing mostly on development in C++ and Python. You can check it out at youtube.com/c/QuantitativeBytes.
